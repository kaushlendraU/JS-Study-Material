# What is Encapsulation ?

Sure! Imagine you have a magic box, and this box has a special rule: only certain things can go in and out in a specific way. This magical rule keeps the contents of the box safe and organized.

In programming, encapsulation is like that magic box. It's a way of organizing and protecting data (information) inside a program. We create these "boxes" called classes, and each class has its own set of rules (methods) for how you can interact with the data inside. These rules help make sure that the data is used correctly and that it stays in a valid and expected state.

So, encapsulation is like putting data in a box (a class) and only allowing it to be accessed or modified in certain ways (methods), just like our magic box only allows things to go in and out in a specific way. This helps keep our program organized, secure, and less prone to errors

so basically it's a way to hide and protect your data from getting accessed or modified by the outside of that purticuler class
